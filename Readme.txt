The main zipped folder, named ‘NC Coursework - Aishwarya and Shalini’ contains four sections as follows:
* Readme.txt, 
* A folder named SVM_MATLABfiles that contains the following:
	1. SVM_Test_BestModel.m file. This is the script to be run by you for SVM.	

	2. SVM_Training_and_optimising_model.m. This script was used to train the SVM model and find the best hyperparameters.

	3. Test_dataset.mat file contains the test data.

	4. The main data set named normdata2.xls that has been loaded into SVM model.

* A folder named MLP_MATLABfiles that contains the following:

	1. test1.m file. This is the script to be run by you for MLP.	

	2. TrainingCode.m. This script was used to train the MLP model and find the best model.	

	3. TrainingData.mat file contains the Training data that has been loaded into the MLP model.
	
	4. TestData.mat file contains the test data that has been loaded into the MLP model.

	5. best_model.mat file contains the best model that has been loaded into the MLP model.

	* NC Coursework Self/Peer assessment in text format and 
* Report named ‘NeuralComputing_Coursework_Report’ in pdf format. The MATLAB code needs MATLAB version MATLAB_R2018b to execute and produce results.
